# My Resume

HTML is designed for documents, and a resume is a document. Why not write your resume in HTML?

As a bonus, now it's a very simple and fully accessible (though admittedly not very mobile-friendly since it's intended to be printed) [webpage](https://iansan5653.github.io/resume/) with hyperlinks & ARIA labels.

If you want to make your resume look like this, a public domain template repo is available here: https://github.com/iansan5653/resume-template
