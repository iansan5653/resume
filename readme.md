# My Resume

I didn't want to keep paying for Microsoft Office just so I can edit my resume, so I rewrote it in HTML/CSS. As a bonus, now it's a very simple and fully accessible (though admittedly not very mobile-friendly since it's intended to be printed) [webpage](https://iansan5653.github.io/resume/) with hyperlinks & ARIA labels. Feel free to fork it for yourself if you like the design; just clear all the info out and reuse the HTML structure & class names.

When I need the PDF form, I just print the webpage with no margins/header/footer and it works great.
